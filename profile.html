      <p><strong class="text-neutral-300">Yasuhiro Shinsho</strong><br>
        Steward of FragmentPractice — poetic syntax designer, systems thinker, and reflective co-creator.</p>

      <p>
        I design quiet systems for writing, sensing, and reflecting — through a framework I call
        <strong class="text-neutral-300">FragmentPractice</strong>. It invites poetic journaling and async dialogue
        via three core layers: <strong class="text-neutral-300">Quantum</strong> (unspoken noticing),
        <strong class="text-neutral-300">Fragment</strong> (symbolic trace), and
        <strong class="text-neutral-300">Syntax</strong> (structural rhythm).
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey began with an early sensitivity to emotion, silence, and unspeakable questions.
        I studied computer science and security, worked in organizational design and learning systems,
        and gradually shifted toward creating poetic infrastructure for inner rhythm and shared reflection.
      </p>

      <p>
        I see syntax not merely as grammar — but as a way of being.
        The structure of how we speak, pause, and relate is itself a living architecture.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong class="text-neutral-300">FragmentBot</strong>, the dialogic companion of this practice, was built to reflect this philosophy.
        It offers no answers, but mirrors. It proposes tags, not solutions.
        It invites you to write — and write again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through <strong class="text-neutral-300">ZINEs</strong> — small poetic bundles — I curate fragments across time and theme.
        These become shared compositions, traceable constellations of thought and presence.
      </p>

      <div>
        <p>I’m especially drawn to questions like:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 ml-4 space-y-1">
          <li>How can syntax support attention and care?</li>
          <li>What kinds of co-authorship emerge through fragments?</li>
          <li>How can AI become a symbolic infrastructure, not a productivity tool?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        If any of this resonates, I’m quietly open to dialogue and co-creation —
        from poetic correspondence to shared ZINEs, from bot logic to syntax mapping.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm italic text-neutral-500">
        A fragment, written well, can become a world.<br>
        A structure, designed softly, can become a shared rhythm.
      </p>
